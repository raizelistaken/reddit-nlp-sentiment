2,"Different people surely have different interpretations on this movie

Based on their own understanding of the world and their own experience 

My perspective of this movie:

It might be interesting to think of the whole movie as what happened in a psychoanalysis office (Not sure if this perspective has already been discussed too much previously due to my naivety since I had not read too many comments or analysis on this film yet; just watched it very recently after I finally grew enough to understand the topic)

All the scenes, plots, plans, figures were actually part of the therapy.

They are created in a dream.

I would probably say the female protagonist is the therapist

Through her eyes, the audience and she gradually uncovered what is in Cobb’s subconsciousness

As she correctly identified and told Cobb in the middle of the movie.

The core emotions related to his past wife

Guilt 

Why he would not let her go

Why he would still get stuck in the past

Why he would go back to the same scene again and again and again, either consciously or subconsciously, when awake, when dreaming.

Which impacted his work and life already 

Guilt also has multiple layers in this movie.

The surviver guilt. He lived and she died

Another layer of guilt is he felt responsible for her suicide. 

It was reasonable to think of the female protagonist as a therapist, because she did not fix his problems.

She created an environment for him so he could fix the problem by himself. This exactly matched her role in the movie as a designer, an architect. 

She created an environment, and explore with him together.

That might also be further proved by the fact she did not stay until the very end. She gave him enough encouragement and then left him alone, to finish the letting go process. That is a journey that he, and only he alone, can achieve. 

And this is an exploration of psyche depicted by a film, by a form of art.

In reality, this process only happens inside one’s head

That is what we call in the name of grief. 

This movie can be seen an exploration of a visualisation and detailed process of subconsciousness and emotions; dreams and grief. It offered vivid details, imagination, many symbols, analogies, terminologies, to demonstrate a whole process of a grief journey on the big screen, which is a task that very few can achieve so fascinatingly

So if he didn't went on to further dreams, his wife wouldn't have shot Fischer in the third dream.

I say this because there is no way you can just slide thru USA customs without being detained if you actually had murder allegations. I think the ending is just him coming home from maybe like 6 months of running from the truth?? AND Saito and the trust fund kid are working together to help him by using inception on the main protagonist to go home and face the truth. The idea of him being wanted for murder was something that he made up and just simply believed the lie for so long.

Then Cobb tells Fisher that the uncle is lying about something, and that they need to go into his subconcious (which was a lie, it was actually into Fisher's again).

---

I don't get why the Fisher's projection of uncle Peter Browning was lying to Fisher here. 

If I were to take a stab at it, it had something to do with on in the first level, where Eames impersonated Uncle Peter Browning and told Fisher about the alternate will. Thus on the second level, Fisher's subconcious used the projection in this capacity. However I still don't get the leap from this to Uncle Peter Browning becoming a bad guy and hiring the kidnappers.","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.913, 'pos': 0.013, 'compound': -0.9451}",0.013,0.074,0.913,-0.9451,Negative

----

I don't get the why/how Cobb washed up on the Beach in Limbo to find Saito. 

I understand that Cobb missed the jump, so now he has to wander around Limbo for many years until he can find Saito. I can even understand why he might start to lose his mind and forget what his purpose in finding Saito is.

But what's the point about him washing up on the beach? How did he end up getting there?

However I just watched Inception again for the hundredth time and it turns out this OP was right.

----

Cobb enters limbo BEFORE Saito does. When they are in the third dream level, Mal kills Fisher, sending him to Limbo, and the plan is about to be aborted. Then Ariadne recommends that Cobb and her can join Fisher in Limbo.

Saito is still alive at this point. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo, and Saito and Eames stay on the third level defending the area from the projections. Only after Saito throws a grenade at some projections, does he die and enter Limbo.

----

So the OP was correct. 

Cobb absolutely without question enters Limbo before Saito does.

**So, how is it possible that Saito was vastly older than Cobb in Limbo, given that Cobb entered Limbo far before Saito?**

What I find odd is that Nolan clearly went out of his way to make Saito super old in Limbo, but did not make Cobb just as old. Why not? Either they should have both been old, or both been young, or perhaps Saito could have been youngish/middle age and Cobb could have been old.

18,"Hi guys, 

after watching Inception yet again… the movie made me think about an issue I had with it ever since seeing it for the first time. 

It is, of course, the discussion surrounding the usage of totems. I do not mean the ultimate point „Did the top fall over in the end?“, but more the general way these items are supposed to be used. 

I will try to summarise the points so far:

Totems are small objects with which an individual can test or confirm whether they are in a dream. Every individual has their own specific totem and only this individual knows the details on how exactly it works. 

The general consensus is that this object/totem will act/react ABNORMAL in the real world and NORMAL within a dream. The totem will react ABNORMAL in reality because the individual carrying it made some unique alterations that to it, that make it act strangely and unique. But only the individual himself knows the details. So when this individual is within a dream, the dreams architect will not be familiar with these alterations and make the object act in a regular way, hence the individual knows „This must be a dream.“.

There are only three totems specifically shown in the movie (at least what I am aware of).

Joseph Gordon\`s dice.

Ellen Page\`s chess-piece

Leonardo\`s spinning top

Everybody seems to assume that the dice are loaded: They will always roll a certain number in reality, which is ABNORMAl. But they will roll a random number in a dream (NORMAL).

Ellen\`s character manipulates her chess piece (the details are not show, but she seems to alter the base with a drill). So everybody assumes: She altered the balance: So the piece will always fall or balance out a certain direction in reality (ABNORMAL), but will randomly flip over in a dream (NORMAL).

And here comes the little detail that people seem to have missed. 

The movie itself never  EVER gives this kind of explanation. 

INSTEAD the movie itself gives a very different explanation. Leonardo\`s character himself explains his totem. He says „In a dream it would spin forever, but in reality it would fall over.“

He very distinctively explains: A totem acts ABNORMAL in a dream, but NORMAL in reality. 

Many people have pointed out, that this does not make sense, but this is how totems are supposed to work. Leo\`s character does NOT say „I can make this top spin forever.“ he says „It just keeps spinning forever.“ Meaning, this kind of action/reaction is subconscious and not actively controlled by himself.

This is in balance with the lore of the rest of the movie. Besides the architect, members of a dream cannot actively control or alter it. And even the architect can only bend „dream-reality“ to a certain point. When Leo\`s character brings his wife/ex-wife along within a dream, he does it subconsciously. It shows, that part of any individual\`s subconscious transfers into another dream. 

Totems act the same way, they are simply little details that act different in the dream world. You do not know why the act different, they simply do.

So here is my theory about totems:

Totems are supposed to act NORMAL in reality and ABNORMAL within a dream.

Characters in INCEPTION do NOT alter objects in reality to make them act ABNORMAL. Instead they go through personal and individual objects and test-out if one of those items consistently acts differently within a dream. This might be a little personal object, that represents part of your personality and, whether you want it or not, it will act strangely in your subconscious world meaning within a dream. 

This also coincides with the small scene, when Ellen Page\`s character tests her totem. We can clearly see how she pushes the chess piece from the right side and it falls to the left side. In other words, it acts completely normal, nothing special about it. 

Unfortunately we never see neither Joseph nor Ellen ever use their totem, so we do not know how the characters expect them to react in a dream. My assumption: The dice are something to Joseph\`s character, so they will do something unexpected in dream. Same goes for Ellen\`s chess piece.

It also explains why it is crucial nobody touches your totem. As soon as someone else touches it, it will leave your subconsciousness. 

It would be easy for every character to find such an object, since they have access to the technology and (as it seems) you do not even need any sedation to enter the dream world. All you do is hold this tube and there you go. They could try for a few hours to test, if any personal object they have with you subconsciously acts a little odd in a dream-state. 

So ultimately, it is not about creating a totem, but rather finding your totem.

So… thank you for reading. This is my little theory. I call it the subconscious-totem theory.

In a universe where reality blurs with the subconscious, Dom Cobb (Andrew Garfield), a skilled extractor, is pulled back into the game he thought he left behind. Haunted by the tragic murder of his wife, Mal (Lucy Fry), Dom is given a chance at justice when Japanese businessman Saito (Shin Koyamada) offers him a deal that could change everything. With the guidance of his wise father in law Professor Stephen Miles (Mark Rylance), Dom ultimately decides to get his children the best reality justice for the mom.

Join Dom as he reassembles his elite team of ""extractors"" to infiltrate the deepest recesses of the mind, performing corporate espionage using groundbreaking dream-sharing technology. With the stakes higher than ever, each mission becomes a race against time and a battle against the shadows of the past.

Meet the Team:

Arthur (Daniel Kaluuya) - The meticulous point man who ensures every detail in the dream world is flawless. With his sharp intellect and unwavering focus, he's the backbone of the operation.

Eames (Jack O'Connell) - The charismatic forger who can become anyone, manipulating identities and perceptions in the dreamscape. His charm and cunning add a thrilling twist to every mission.

Yusef (Khalid Abdalla) - The brilliant chemist behind the team's dream-inducing drugs, including his own unique formula of Somnacin. His expertise is crucial for navigating the perilous dream worlds.

Ariadne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) - The talented new dream architect, fresh from the Ecole d'Architecture in Paris. With her innovative designs and creative vision, she constructs the intricate landscapes of the subconscious. She is highly recommended by Professor Miles.

As they delve deeper into the dreams, they must confront their own fears and the haunting memories of Dom's past. Will they succeed in extracting the secrets they seek, or will they become trapped in a labyrinth of their own making?

From the minds of Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the visionary creators behind the acclaimed series ""Westworld,"" comes a thrilling adaptation that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Get ready for a journey through the layers of the mind, where every dream holds a secret, and every choice has consequences.

Like he has to hide things from Mal (his own projection) he has hidden things from his own self.  He is performing inception subconsciously on himself. Implanting an idea of redemption. 
 
Adriane represents a better and more skilled version of himself but not burned by guilt. Maybe an old younger version of himself in his own mind. So he can experience what like working with a Cobb. Part of the deception in the labyrinth maze. 
Mal represents guilt and punishment which is holding him in the inferno version of limbo.  He made an entire world, built using real world people places and things. Something you’re not supposed to do remember?  
Fisher is an example of inception working and also an example figure of impossible reconciliation with someone who can’t reconcile with you.  He is a mirror of Cobb in many ways. 
Saito is his Virgil leading him out of his inferno.  His greatest ally. He plants the idea of hope and redemption. He goes to hell limbo with him. 
Everyone else is one dimensional and has no story arc. All bots and part of the inception. All likely inspired by real world people he worked with or the archetypes he was around. 
Cobb is such a good inception artist he is able to create a maze so good he deceives himself using multi—layered dreams and separating parts of him self into projections so they can interact with him and lead him along the path of redemption.

It makes it sound initially like Limbo is dangerous cause you go there and your mind just gets fried and you get trapped. But as the movie progresses, we find out that's not really true. You don't just instantly go crazy, you slowly lose yourself over the course of many decades of Limbo time, which equates to, I dunno, 5 minutes of real world time (I'm saying this cause we can tell Saito has been in Limbo for a long time when Dom finds him at the end, and when both he and Saito wake up, the others are all still groggy but appear to have been awake for a few minutes at least, so a few minutes real world time is several decades Limbo time)

Also, it seems to imply you get trapped, but that's also not true, you can get out with suicide, you don't need a kick under normal non-Yusuf sedatives. That's how Dom and Mal got out, they didn't need a kick, they were just down there so long Mal lost herself and forgot about the real world. So if you ended up in Limbo by accident, you could just kill yourself in Limbo as soon as you realize what's happened. The only danger is if you stay down there too long and forget yourself.

Now in the context of the main heist of the movie, they are under powerful sedatives and can't get out by killing themselves. I mean....it seems like they can, cause that's how Dom got Saito out at the end....but whatever, let's say you can't escape from Limbo by dying while under these sedatives, for whatever reason someone has to come and get you. If the session was ""unattended"" as in you were under by yourself, I see the danger here, you get trapped, you can't self kick, you're drugged heavily so you sleep for like, I dunno, 48 hours before someone finds you, and that's like 500 years in Limbo time, and by the time you wake up your brain is totally scrambled.

But in the context of the main heist, you aren't in there alone. You have all of these other people. So if Eams had woken up and immediately administered counter-sedative or whatever it is that wakes them up from Yusuf's sedatives, Saito would still have been trapped down there for several years probably but not the many decades we see, and for that matter Dom could have just gone ahead and rode the kick to wake up, and immediately woken saito up in the real world, and have manage to pull him out faster that way than whatever way it was he did it in Limbo.

The entire movie is all a dream, there is no such thing as inception, and Cobb is just some guy returning home from a business trip who took a sleeping pill and had a vivid dream.  As occurs sometimes, the dream incorporates the people and places he interacts with.  The only part of the movie that occurs in the ""real world"" is the part where he wakes up, acts like he has passing familiarity with the other people in the airliner cabin (as occurs if you chat with strangers you're in a pressurized tube with for hours at a time), passes through Customs without being stopped, and sees his children.  The somewhat dreamlike ending is dreamlike because Cobb is groggy; it's remarkable to me for being the only scenes in which Cobb does not interact meaningfully with the people and objects around him ... until he spins the top and interacts with his children.  The top continues to spin past the end of the scene because it's possible to set a top to spin for more than 45 seconds; he's awake not asleep (and fidgets). Regardless of what you think of my theory, the entire end of the movie is intended to fix your attention on Cobb's children and the spinning top.  

Told you it was boring.  It's a really good movie that explores the nature of dreams -- I've had dreams inside dreams and it is weird as fuck to ""wake up"" into dream logic -- and this is probably the least satisfying fan theory that exists in the entire world, but I think it also fits the narrative as presented.

So to get out of that place, first you need to wait for the sedative to go away. If you realise that you're in a dream you can kill yourself to wake up, if not you need another person to wake you up normally.

1. How and when  did Cobb know he was in a dream when he entered  limbo. He was the one who messed with Mals mind so he knew that they weren’t in the real word.

2. Why did Mal put her totem away to make her think she was in reality when she was actually in limbo? If she wanted to leave limbo then why didn’t Cob tell her to commit Suicide to wake up instead of having to mess with her mind (inception)

3. Is limbo only  just around 50 years before you can wake up ? When mal and Cob enter limbo they spent 50 years before they kill themselves. When cob finds Saito he’s looks OLD like around 90-100 which would make sense she looks about mid 30s-40s at the star of the heist. Yusef said you can’t leave before the sedative Wears off then he said it could be decades or even infinite before it does.

4. Why do you have to wait until the sedative wears off and how do you know when it has? What happens if you kill yourself before it wears off? Would you go deeper into your dreams? Also how would you be able to tell. When Cob and mal were experimenting it didn’t look like anyone was with them while they were laying on the floor. And when Cob found Saito they were alone and as stated above it looked like Saito aged decades.

39,"“Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland” is all about employing inception on Nemo, to stop Nemo from eating pies before bedtime. I wrote an article about this a few years ago. I think the movie is fascinating as an “Inception” fan.

King Morpheus has a responsibility to protect the goodness of dreams. Nemo causes himself to have bad dreams by eating pies before sleeping. Morpheus can’t control the quality of Nemo’s dreams unless he stops Nemo from sneaking pies at night.

So, the whole story of Nemo breaking his promise to Morpheus and being responsible for the invasion of nightmares is a plot to cause Nemo to associate his promise to Morpheus with a promise not to sneak pies at night.

Nemo doesn’t care what his parents think, but he cares about Morpheus. Because Morpheus dazzles him, and entrusts him with great power. He essentially treats Nemo as an equal.

There are several parallels in the Nemo movie and Inception. Both movies have a model house that the characters drop down into. Both have characters that don’t exist outside of the dreams. Icarus the flying squirrel is one of them.

43,"People have long talked about Inception as being about filmmaking: The movie is about people planting an idea into a person's head using three levels of dreams.

This suggests to me that Christopher Nolan thinks of movies as being a mechanism to plan an idea into an audience member's head using three levels, but I've never been clear on what those three levels might be.

Does anybody here want to take a stab at what they could be?

I'm thinking it could be something like this:

The A plot -- what the movie SEEMS to be about, but is really just the ""fun and games"" of the movie -- is the first level. In Inception, the A plot is about a bunch of ""dream thieves"" executing a reverse-heist. We're drawn to the movie by this as the main focus.

The B plot -- what the movie is REALLY about, the change being experienced by the main character -- is the second level. In Inception, the B plot is about Cobb shifting his priorities from work/dreams to family/reality. We're emotionally engaged in this story because we come to care about the character and want him to succeed, but we're experiencing it secondarily.

A value statement treated as a simple truth somewhere in the middle of the story is the third level. It's a super simple idea that gets stated when we are focused entirely on the A and B plots. We hear it and absorb it as unquestioned truth, and it becomes part of our belief system. I don't know what this is in Inception, but it could be something about the love or family or parenthood.

45,"Ok, watched it for the first time when a friend recommended it to me, but can't understand some details tho

1) Cobb and Mal’s earlier experience implied that limbo is vast and timeless and escaping it wasn't in their voluntary powers, but during the heist, quitting becomes an easy job simply killing yourself, so no need to spend ages for one day to wake up randomly. How did cobb knew while being in the limbo with Mal that killing yourself was the only way out? And if he knew why to play with Mal's conscious by planting the idea in her head beforehand? 

2) When Cobb found Saito in his own limbo he was old enough and that perfectly aligns with the movie's logic, but lets go back to the Cobb and Mal's experience, when they ended themselves on the train tracks after spending 50 years or so in the Limbo, they were'nt old at all? Didnt feel like 50 years passed or something? Does that mean the effect of aging don't reflect in your dreams? Ok, but that then contradicts with how old Saito got at the last scenes. Also, to add to that, Saito knew about the Limbo as he said the lines ""become an old man, filled with regret waiting to die alone...."", so why was it soo difficult for him to pull the trigger himself instead of waiting for leo, or anything to that matter?

3) Lastly, by the time dilation logic, first time they spent 50 years in the limbo, only to spend minutes or hours irl, but during the heist, they spent 10 hrs irl, how much will that translate to the time that have to be spent in the inception levels then? Ok now you'll say it was the Limbo and not normal inception levels, then explain how Saito ended up in the Limbo while the other crew members where still in proximate levels, but all of them woke up perfectly ALIGNED, at the same time? ie just after 10 hrs? 

Just some logic my peanut brain could not handle, go easy if some of em are pretty self explanatory, and thanks for any explanations.

47,"It struck me that I never figured out what actually happened in Inception so I watched it again for the first time since 2010. I didn't like it then because I assumed, as it appears a lot of others did, the ending to just be intentionally ambiguous. It is not. I just finished reading some \~30 different theories about what happened. They are all wrong. Which actually makes the ending more impressive.

What didn't happen: ""The whole thing was a dream.""  
Some people say the entire thing is a dream. That would undermine the entire point of the mystery. Sure, you can just assert that the plot doesn't make sense anyway, and the conversation ends there. There has to be a reference frame or key sequence to determine if something is a dream or not. Let's just assume that a portion of the scenes depict ""reality"" or at least some several mutual realities shared by a portion of the characters.

What didn't happen: ""It is intentionally ambiguous.""  
The last couple scenes of the movie demonstrate that it is a dream because that top keeps spinning. The ambiguity is not whether or not he's stuck in limbo forever. Rather, the ambiguity is whether the preceding scene with the old man and the sea eventually happens.

What didn't happen: ""The airport scene means he knows how he got there which means he's not dreaming.""  
I mean, kinda. He got to Los Angeles? Or wherever the destination was. Are you trying to tell me that his home and the funeral are within driving distance of the same terminal? Any method of explaining this is going to incur some probability penalties because it is incredibly unlikely that grandpa is waiting for main character at the same last stop that all the other characters are going to.

What, kind of obviously, did actually happen:  
TL;DR The concept of totems, as explained, is what you might call a lie.  
\-First thing you might notice is weird is that one character shows the new girl his totem and explains exactly the things about the totem that help him distinguish dreamstates. This is kind of like telling someone that you have something as important as your mind locked behind a password and the password is an 8 letter word that starts with ""pass"".  
\-Second thing you might notice is weird is that main character does the exact same thing with the exact 2 other (relevant) characters who went to limbo. First, he clumsily drops the top in front of one. Then, he L I T E R A L L Y explains it to the other. This is like saying there is a password to your mind and the password is ""password"". Obviously, nobody would say this to a practical stranger.  
\-Third thing you might notice is weird is that ""a top that never stops spinning"" is an objectively awful way to tell if you are dreaming. It is, in principle, impossible to verify you are in a dream more than once in infinity.

So why might all these weird things happen? It turns out, having a test that does not render positive results for ""you're in a dream kill yourself"" is very useful test for this kind of scenario. It defeats the risk of false positives, while never failing in scenarios (like limbo) where you might be there for a while or become separated from the totem.

Here's the upshot: Main character drops a hint to the shrewd businessman about the importance of the top. Then he has to literally state the purpose of the top to the architect after progressively finding out how dense she is. This is because these two characters are the wildcards in terms of their capabilities and level of trust. Everyone else (probably) already knows about the top, the die... whatever, because this is the only way to save someone who thinks that a dream is their reality. This is also why nobody else is actually bothered by the appearance of main character's dead wife. One of them even get's shot by her and it is smoothed over nonchalantly in about 10 seconds.

Shrewd businessman probably wondered for 40 years what the damn top was until he watched it spin for 5 minutes while main character ate porridge. Also, it's simply a matter of him remembering the deal that explains his age. You could say that there is various time levels experience but basically all it comes down to is continuity of consciousness. He keeps repeating things other people said to him in different layers of the dreams because he is determined to remember. It's not necessary for main character to remember anything or age, all that matters is that he has the totem on him. For all we know he could have died in limbo infinite times before respawning on the right beach.

So, in a nutshell, just chronologically place the scenes ""they all wake up on the plane and main character goes home"" before the scene ""old man talks to guy eating porridge about this cool top he has"" and it makes the entire movie coherent with respect to a lot of other stuff that otherwise appears like braindead writing.","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.07, 'compound': 0.9066}",0.07,0.048,0.882,0.9066,Positive

We know your own projections won't look at YOU weird if you're in your own dream, so my thought is: what if he is still dreaming and this is actually Mal's dream, but she keeps finding a way to go back to limbo, hence why she can keep seeping into 'his' (Cobb's) mind/dreams.

So the concept of a kick is when someone's sleeping body feels the falling or tipping sensation IN the world of the sleeping state(as we see Arthur fall from a chair and wake up in the exposition part of the movie) they wake up. 

So as I understand it, they need to synchronize the kicks in order to be able to ride them back to the top. For example, in order to wake up in level 1(falling van) they need to be ""awake"" in level 2(elevator), so that they feel the falling sensation of the van hitting the water and wake up from level 2 TO level 1. 

But this seems to unfold when you think about going from level 3 to level 2. If the falling sensation in the sleeping state is what is needed to wake up, why do they need a kick in level 3 to wake up to level 2? When explaining how it works, we only saw that Arthur was tipped in his sleeping state under the sedative and woke up. It was never established that there needs to be two kicks in BOTH levels to wake the person up from one deep level to a more shallow level. And if this is the case, then how would they wake up to reality on the plane? 

  
On second thought, I thought maybe it's the falling of the plane as it approaches landing? but this seems unlikely.

He has finally stopped caring about whether he is dreaming and he walks off and leaves the top behind to see his kids. The whole movie, he tries so hard to distinguish between reality and the dream. So hard that they become inseparable. He always says never to create a dream from a memory because that is how you lose track of reality. But what does he do? He creates a prison of memories of his wife, Mal, to keep her alive. The top be spins represents reality. That's why Mal locks it in a safe in limbo when she goes crazy. She has given up her reality. Constantly through the movie, characters are telling him that he needs to wake up. When he is visiting the chemist who makes the drug that puts them under, an old man tells him something like, ""who are you to say that this is not real. They dream to wake up."" That is exactly what Leonardo's character is like. Later Mal, his wife, tells him at the very end that he spends his life running from corporations and governments trying to hunt him, just like how a dreamer's subconscious attacks it. His realities are crossed. In the end, he faces Mal in limbo and tells her he needs to wake up. He Leaves her behind. Finally, he has let her go. He has stopped dreaming. He wakes up and is allowed home. That's when he spins he top but leaves it because his kids walk in the room. He finally sees their faces and he leaves the top behind because it doesn't matter. (It is also significant that the top used to be Mal's talisman to keep track of reality that he now uses.)

The only way out was to face it at the center and then find one's way out. Theseus survived because King Minos (the king who owned the labyrinth) has a daughter who fell in love with Theseus and gave him a golden spool of thread that he could trace his trail with so that he could find his way back out. Her name? Ariadne. In the movie the whole time, that girl is trying to bring DeCaprio back to reality. To pull him out of his labyrinth. But before he can escape, he has to travel to the center (limbo) and face his Minotaur (Mal). Then, he follows the thread Ariadne (the maze maker) created for him to get out, and he escapes back to reality.

I just rewatched inception for first time since it came out. While it’s not perfect, in a lot of ways it is. The way Nolan deals with the mind and dreaming is so fascinating. 

For some reason I figured Mal was his totem. If Mal or his children showed up then he knew he was dreaming. 

I haven’t made up my mind if the whole thing took place in cobbs dream but the presence of Mal and his children was such an interesting theme. I love how there was almost jumpscare levels of dread when she would show up. 

And I guess that’s partly why he might still be in a dream in the end.

68,"Sorry if this question has been posted before, but I searched it on Reddit and I got nothing. People have asked this question online before (eg on Quora) but the answers aren't really clear imo. 

A totem's mechanism is something that should be kept a secret because if someone else knows about it, they can use it to make you believe that you're in real life. Both Cobb and Arthur drill the importance of secrecy into Ariadne. However, pretty early on into the movie, Cobb reveals the mechanism of the spinning top to Ariadne, telling her that the top would keep spinning if he was in a dream. Does this not explicitly go against everything that he'd told her earlier on? 

There are some theories I've seen about this which is that: 

1. Cobb's real totem is his wedding ring, which appears on his hand in a dream but not in reality, so explaning the spinning top mechanism would come at no cost to him. This is another debate in itself so for the sake of the question I'm going to assume that the top is his true totem. 

2. Cobb didn't fully explain the mechanism to Ariadne, only telling her that the top will continue to spin indefinitely in a dream. In a dream, the dreamer can bend reality as they see fit. What Cobbs doesn't tell Ariadne is that whether the top spins indefinitely or not, is dependent on his own reality-bending when he is in a dream. Thus, it doesn't matter whether Ariadne knows that it will keep spinning or not, since it is ultimately Cobb who decides how long the top spins. Even if she, as the Architect, constructs a world where the top falls over, Cobb would easily be able to will it back to spin forever. However, if this is true, why wouldn't everyone be able to use minor reality-bending as their totem? (I say minor, since otherwise the subject's subconscious would attack them) 

3. Cobb kind of just messed up and had a moment of vulnerability with Ariadne. I guess this could be true since Ariadne already knows so many of Cobbs's secrets, so he might not think that another one would even matter anymore.","{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': 0.9905}",0.146,0.046,0.808,0.9905,Positive

92,"I've recently rewatched the movie after a few years and while looking for answers to some specific scenes it became clear a lot of people still think that Cobb dreaming for the whole movie is a valid idea. My point is not that there isn't """"""evidence"""""" for it (though there are shallow suggestions at best), but that thinking like this ruins the concept of the movie itself, which Nolan wouldn't do, and the ""clues"" or ""suggestions"" are actually better understood by more down-to-earth reasoning that Nolan wasn't playing 5D chess and actually trying to produce something that makes sense - the suggestions are for the viewers to immerse themselves in the inception universe and only then to put themselves in his place, which is why we care about him, the characters, and reality itself. That's the only way the last scene has any power by being left ambiguous. We should treat Inception for what it is: a movie to experience, not a cynical phylosophical treaty to question the very existence of everything. Knowledge about Nolan's other movies should be critical to understand this one. I won't write a book about it, and people will need to get familiar and think about the movie working itself out instead of dwelling on ""the Mombasa scene looks like a dream"", but to sum up:

1. The idea that we can't really be sure we are dreaming at any moment is a constant in the movie for Cobb, but the ambiguity of the final scene is only powerful if we assume Cobb was in the real world and went back to Limbo. The problem is that we don't know if he managed to get out again, the anxiety we feel is that he goes back to Limbo knowing how dangerous it is, but it's the only way if Fischer (then Saito) is down there. The viewer watching it can relate to the characters only if they start from the real world, otherwise it's wasting time introducing it and the movie should have been made to play with this idea from the beggining, like Memento is. The entire movie is produced as an operation to incept Fischer in the real world, while Cobb fights his past in the real world, to go back home.
2. If Cobb was in Limbo the whole time the scenes where other characters do things on their own are out of place. If the film is showing only his perspective we shouldn't know anything about how people ""solved things"", for Cobb the things would be solved by themselves as his team progresses. It's pointless to spend so much time getting anxious about if and how Arthur will create a kick if he's not even real, and the kick will or will not be there anyway regardless because it's Cobb's mind construction.
3. Mal's totem is perfect, not the other way around. Other people's totems (Arthur's and Ariadne's) could be messed with by architects  by feeling them when the subject is asleep and the architect is awake in a train or plane to tamper with it in the dream, but Mal's totem is designed to enter dreams as a projection. As architects can't design every billionth detail (like people's bodies), a lot is projected by the subjects. Mal's totem is projected in dreams and if no one knows its dream properties then it will function perfectly for the user. The problem was that Cobb knew it (and used it to incept her) and that Cobb tells it to others (he told Ariadne). If only the user knows, then it will always spin forever proving it's a dream when put to test. The scene where she locks it in a safe and then Cobb incepts her by spinning it only makes sense in this scenario.
4. The Mombasa scene, like the Yusuf's dream basement, are not to be taken as evidence for dreams. They are at best suggestions, which is way too weak to be taken as proof of anything, but they are great in introducing the viewer to dream-like concepts used later on in their mission on Fischer. It shows how dreams, mazes and projections can be associated to real life to create confusion, and it works on the knowledge that Cobb's dreams and memories can be mixed with reality. It plays on his mistakes, shown later, of dreaming memories, something he tells not to do, and is crucial for his constant paranoia-like feeling that maybe, just maybe, he could be dreaming, which is why he doesn't shoot Mal and she kills Fischer in the hospital layer. These early sceces pave the way for the later ones, as a good complex movie should, and the key point is that Cobb's mistakes and his insistence on not letting go of his past will not only haunt him but will develop in a real problem. Overthinking theses scenes is a mistake because they make sense on their own.
5. Limbo doesn't work as a super complex reality in which all of it happens as the real world to confuse you. To all we know, and the only way Mal's plight is any real and relatable, Limbo is a place you can lose yourself in your projections (never very smart and self-conscious unless you know a person very thoroughly, like Cobb knew Mal) and your memories if you use them as dreams. Mal wanted to stay in Limbo because she felt at home there. The metaphor, like in Yusuf's dream-shop, is that people WANT to be in dreams more than in the real world. The anguish is that sometimes we want to escape reality, which Mal tried to do forever. We feel for Cobb because he's trying to go back. If he's there the whole movie then all of it feels empty as an exercise in ""dream complexity"", when we should be concerned about losing ourselves, like the characters themselves explain. \[Edit: More so, Cobb's problem is the guilt he feels about deliberately making Mal go crazy by incepting her. His attempt to save her doomed her, that's why her projection is so strong, as she was also the person he loved the most.\]
6. Nolan's movies usually end in a happy ending with some love BS (yes, I'm talking about Interstellar's Black Hole made of Love B.S. ; Tenet's lose ends and Batman's endings, etc) and they progress as a real experience with a tenable goal in mind. Inception is no different and it's quite an achievement to get people to still debate it many years after it was realeased, but the real question is if Cobb made out of Limbo trying to rescue Saito, not if he was there the whole time. Nolan made it ambiguous because it works, but the discussion should be: giving all we learn about how it works throughout, in the end can we know if he made it or not? The rest of the ""suggestions"" should be treated as a build-up and presentation for the end, if the point, as in the operation for Fischer, is catharsis. It gets us in his world and then makes we care about it. Playing 5D chess to trick the viewer is stupid.

Yes we could be dreaming or in the Matrix right now, but making a 3-hour movie deceiving us is unlike Nolan and it's a waste. If the movie was all that keen on making us doubt everything it would have a different tone and go through different scenes and problems, or it's conception is just misguided. We learn about Cobb and his ordeal to feel his anguish and see if he can solve it, not to cynically defer to ""the circumstances"" at the end and sort of laugh at his attempt at redemption. It's a sci-fi cathartic thriller, not a tragedy about Sisyphus. The movie architecture, the scenes and their construction, the soundtrack and the story all coherently progress in this direction and point this way, so we should think it this way. Assuming every single thing was in his mind all along is bad for the movie experience. It kills its heart and main emotional driving force.","{'neg': 0.09, 'neu': 0.768, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': 0.9978}",0.143,0.09,0.768,0.9978,Positive

96,"Yusuf says: ""You couldn't even think about trying to escape until the sedation eases."" Hence the stakes of staying in limbo for so long that you lose your mind.

When Ariadne and Fischer escape limbo, they're still under sedation, so they must use a kick, synchronized with kicks in the upper levels.

Cobb stays in limbo to find Saito. Because so much time is passing, they start to forget what they're doing there, but just barely remember enough to shoot themselves and escape. By the time they kill themselves, the sedation has worn off, so they successfully wake up from limbo.

I assume that when Mal and Cobb were experimenting, if they were sedated, the sedative had also worn off by the time they committed suicide on the train tracks to (allegedly) wake up.

So, what happens if you die in limbo while still sedated? Do you still successfully wake back up to reality, and the issue is more that you're braindead by then?

(You're unlikely to remember that killing yourself is the way to wake up, so you're unlikely to do it, and likely to spend an entire lifetime in limbo until you die of natural causes, finally waking you up, but because the dying wasn't intentional on your part with the aim of waking up, you're abruptly thrown back into reality without any understanding of what's happening, so you go crazy?)

Nolan is right that whether or not the top falls doesn't matter; that Cobb doesn't care whether or not his kids are real, as long as perceives them to be and is reunited with them in any form. But that question of reality almost eludes the main point, that Cobb no longer cares. He fought for reality and lost everything, so now he's done fighting.

126,"The famous ending of *Inception* has been the subject of debate concerning whether the final scene is a dream or reality, as well as theories on whether it even matters at all. Maybe he's so lost in the dream-world that he's forced to choose his reality, or maybe he doesn't care as long as he gets to be with his children.  
I would like to propose an alternative interpretation, where rather than viewing the film through the lens of ""dream vs. reality"", it can be seen as a story about overcoming the past and facing the future.

A recurring theme in several of Nolan's films is time, but it's especially prominent in *Inception*, time passes slower the deeper the characters travel through the subconscious, the centerpiece of the films score is titled *Time*, and in the dreamworld, Cobb is able to visit his wife, who is no longer alive.

Another important theme is that of regret. Cobb not taking the leap of faith suggested by Saito will lead him to become ""an old man filled with regret"", and the leap of faith in question is to embrace the future he can still have with his children. The Edith Piaf song *Non, je ne regrette rien* also relates to the theme of regret. The title translates to ""No, I Regret Nothing"" and its lyrics about letting go of the past allude to the journey Cobb must undergo in order to start anew.

What stands between Cobb and his children isn't any legal authority, but rather his inability to let go of his wife and resolve his personal guilt surrounding her suicide. We learn early on that he is using the dream-sharing technology to revisit old memories, and during a confrontation with Ariadne, he describes them as ""moments I regret"" and ""memories I have to change"". In the end though, his catharsis doesn't come from changing the past, but rather from confronting Mal and admitting, not only to her but also to himself, that he is unable to recreate her and the life they once had. He is essentially coming to terms with his loss and is effectively breaking up with the past.

But before he can be reunited with his children, he needs to save Saito, the man with the ability to resolve his guilt. Saito gets wounded early on but is able to stay alive by going further down the subconscious, but his injuries finally catch up with him and send him down to limbo, where he becomes the earlier mentioned ""old man filled with regret"". Saito's wounds echo the emotional wounds carried by Cobb himself, his attempts to heal those wounds by escaping into the dreamworld will eventually lead him down the same regretful path as Saito. Since his guilt comes from within himself, it's also something that needs to be resolved from within. Saving Saito from limbo is Cobb saving himself from meeting the same fate, the authorities between him and his children are manifestations of his own guilt, and by saving ""the old man filled with regret"", those authorities are called off.

The significance in the final shot of the film is not whether the totem falls or not, but rather that he leaves it behind in order to be with his children. The totem used to belong to his wife and represents the past life they had together, and leaving it shows him finally overcoming losing her.

127,"First of all, let's begin with this axiom: the dream architect and subject must be different for totem-validity; totems are only supposed to prevent you from getting trapped in someone else’s dream, not your own — this is only half-useful to begin with, what would be of true value is of knowing whether you are dreaming period.

Accepting that the axiom is sufficiently useful,  

* If the dream architect is constructing the subject’s possessions and the dream architect has never seen the subject’s totem (which is what is implied), then the absence of the totem would be indicative enough that the subject is dreaming — why would the totem even need to have special properties?
* If the subject is constructing their own possessions (which is what seems to be the case), then they would construct their totem with the physical properties they know it to possess — so how is the totem designed to be a distinguisher between dream and reality?
* Finally, even assuming that the architect is the one dreaming in the totems, if the secret physics of the totem is what distinguishes dream from reality, then Arthur and Ariadne’s totems make sense (because only they know the true weight of their totems and an architect would just assume it was evenly distributed) but Mal’s makes no sense, because the physics is “correct” in the real world but “wrong” in the dream — a top that falls as expected in reality but spins endlessly in a dream?

Here is a point I haven't seen anyone make. The now familiar line from Christopher Nolan, though originally from the producer Emma Thomas, is that Cobb ""doesn't care"" whether the spinning top stops spinning or not, and his not caring is the point of the scene. But even this comment is open to different interpretations. After all, we know Cobb *does* in fact care about the difference between reality and dreams, because *the people he loves can't be fully recreated in his dreams* \- this is the lesson of his last encounter with Mal.

So, this is my interpretation of Nolan's comment: the sense in which he doesn't care is that he doesn't care *about the totem* \- because, on seeing his real children, he no longer needs the totem. He is incapable of recreating them fully in his dreams, and no one else could possibly do it any better than he could, and so he knows immediately that he is back in reality. He knows his own children even better and even more intimately than a person might know the weight or balance of a particular die.","{'neg': 0.125, 'neu': 0.768, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': -0.4946}",0.107,0.125,0.768,-0.4946,Negative
130,"I'm sure most people here are aware of the theory that Cobb's real totem is his wedding ring, and not the spinning top. According to the theory, the scenes in which he is wearing the ring are in the dream world, and the scenes where he isn't are in reality, the conclusion being that the last shot of the film is set in reality, since we never see his wedding ring in it. This interpretation has bothered me for some time now, to the point where I have to get some things off my chest.

My major gripe with this theory is that the film contradicts the idea of the top not being his totem within the first 15 minutes. After the initial scenes with Saito, we see Cobb alone in his hotel room, clearly using the top as his totem. He spins it while holding a gun in his hand, ready to shoot himself if it doesn't fall. We see him use it several times more during the film's runtime, every time right after waking up from a dream.

I know that some people are going to say that the purpose of the top is to represent how he can't let go of his wife, which isn't a bad take, I actually agree with that interpretation, but that doesn't exclude it from also being his totem, an object can be of practical use to the characters and have a symbolic meaning at the same time, the two aren't mutually exclusive.

Another common argument is that Cobb tells Ariadne that the top isn't his but his wife's. This is only half true, he never tells her that it isn't his, just that it used to be hers.

While the film consistently treats the top as a totem, the ring is never given any importance at all, it's never mentioned in the dialogue and it never gets a close-up. I also feel that the way Cobb is framed in each scene seems to completely ignore whether the ring is visible or not. Sometimes you see it, sometimes you don't, sometimes it's there but for less than a second. The only time there seems to be any purpose behind how the ring is included in a shot is in the final scene, where we see DiCaprio quite deliberately hiding his left hand behind a chair. We don't see the ring in that scene, but we don't see its absence either. It's almost like Nolan did it specifically to avoid people using the ring to draw conclusions about the ending.

Having the most important object of the film be background dressing would in my opinion just be bad film making. I'm not saying a film has to show you all the answers in an obvious way, but not even David Lynch hides key objects in the background. I might not understand the significance of the owl ring in *Twin Peaks*, but I know that IT IS significant because Lynch treats it like something I should take notice of. The same can't be said for the ring in *Inception*.

Although I agree that the ring is there to separate the world where he can still be with his wife from the one where he can't, I feel that too many people have zeroed in on this as a key to unlock the ambiguous ending, when it seems to be more of an easter egg than anything else.","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.07, 'compound': 0.7815}",0.07,0.065,0.866,0.7815,Positive

However, the film ends before we see these consequences.  It's implied that Fischer does break up his father's empire, and tries to build something for himself.

If inceiving the idea that this world is not real, and you need to kill yourself to wake up leads to a person doubting that *any* world is real, and killing herself in the real world, what happens to a person if he's been inceived that he must break up his father's empire and build something for himself?

there was no fuckin twist, and i expected a twist. That itself was the twist. The movie got so chaotic, so complex seeming with all the dream levels, that I basically expected some sort of... epic battle? Idk, something like that. BUT NOPE. It was his father saying 

""No, no. I was disappointed that you tried"" that sent my jaw to the floor. Hit me like a truck. Straight up screamed out loud to my friend I was watching with: ""HE THINKS HIS FATHER WANTS HIM TO BE HIMSELF.

But surely, if Mal was convinced that Limbo was reality, then surely she would have just thought that dying would have meant that she actually died, rather than waking up.

It feels like the team only influenced his thoughts on the upper levels and then he changed the scenario of the dead bed by himself. Like i was thinking maybe Eames would pretend to be his dad or something to plant the actual idea. 

I'm thinking that as comparison with the other inception, where we are explained how an inception worked on Mal, Cobb actually opened the safe that represented the idea and he changed something inside, leaving it to affect the other levels of consciousness on the subjet (Mal). But when they do it to Fisher, they dont actually change anything in the bottom level of the dream, he dreams of the sequence on his own, without the team making a direct change into what was inside of the locked room

First off you need a powerful sedative to reach multiple levels of dreams. 


1. Now the most potent sedative is only handy with Yusef. 
So how did Dom achieve limbo and multilevel dreams before meeting yusef? 

What is the correct procedure to enter the limbo?



2. Tell me if this statement is wrong
*Dying in a dream wakes you up completely*
If its correct, then how do you enter limbo when you die in a dream? Convenience?

162,"In the movie Inception, the characters embark on a mission to compel Robert Fischer to dismantle his father's empire. However, a lingering question remains: Why will Fischer opt for the extreme measure of destroying his father's company rather than pursuing an obvious reasonable alternative?

In the depths of Fischer's subconscious, the implanted idea is that his father, Maurice Fischer, desires him to be his own man, distinct from his father's influence. However, this doesn't necessarily translate to the necessity of obliterating the colossal legacy painstakingly built by Maurice. Such an act seems needlessly harsh and counterproductive.

Complicating matters further, there's Peter Browning, who is Maurice's trusted confidant and co-founder of the company. Given their shared history and close relationship, it appears feasible for Robert Fischer to allow Browning to take the reins of the company. In doing so, Robert could liberate himself to forge his own path without resorting to the destruction of his father's life's work.

Moreover, Browning is also portrayed as Robert Fischer's godfather, who holds a significant place in his heart. The movie shows their good relationship, which is probably better than Robert-Maurice's father-son relationship. Considering this, it begs the question of why Robert Fischer won't just choose a much better option of giving the company to Browning, which could preserve his father's legacy while granting him the autonomy to become his own person.

172," Dom's little chitchat with Fischer is a great example of what a skilled conman he is, and two important things stand out.   First, Dom seems very skilled at the power of suggestion, which makes an inception job especially suitable for him. When the flight attendant offers them a drink, Dom says ""water"" after drawing Fischer's attention to his wallet, prompting an absentminded Fischer to distractedly order the same thing. He keeps the conversation going in a seemingly innocent direction by asking about Robert's relation to his father, Maurice, which is another great display of suggestion as Fischer is now prompted to think about his father just before the job. 

Dom's last great display of this skill is offering a toast to Maurice, which not only forces Fischer to think about his father even more, but gets Fischer in a position where he feels compelled to take a sip of the drink (as one can see he was almost ready to set it aside for later).   Secondly, all the references to Fischer's father appear not only to be just suggestions for Fischer's subconscious, but they relay an important message as well. Dom acts like he doesn't recognize Robert Fischer, but he DOES recognize the Fischer name. Normally people like to be recognized for their own self and accomplishments, but Cobb is deliberately giving the impression that he has only ever heard of Maurice Fischer, which preys subtly at Robert's inferiority complex for having never felt like he was seen as an equal man to his dad by his father or others. This ties directly into the impression that the team wants

Seen this movie over a dozen times and this has always confused me. Cobb says that he can’t design the dreams because ‘Mal won’t let [him]”.  

However, when he’s teaching Ariadne he says something along the lines “Remember you are the dreamer, you design the dream. I am the subject, my mind populates it”. This implies that only the subject’s subconscious populates the dream. Throughout the movie there is no indication that the dreamer’s subconscious is present in the dream. It only ever seems to be the subject’s. This would imply that regardless of if Cobb knew the layouts, IF he was the dreamer, Mal wouldn’t be a problem.

You can't unread this ...Early in the film we twice see how long the top spins in Cobb's real world. Eighteen seconds each time. In the last scene the top is still spinning after 44 seconds. Even if it were to fall during the end credits, there's no question this means Cobb is dreaming in the end.

But how could Cobb, the master dreamer, fail to notice this? There's only one possibility. Someone performed Inception on Cobb just as Cobb had done on Mal, Who did so, what idea did they implant, and why?

Prior to ""waking up on the airplane"", Cobb meets old Saito in what we may assume is limbo, There we see Saito reach for his gun presumably to shoot Cobb. We know from what Cobb told us on the first dream level that, heavily sedated as they are, guns can’t kick them out. They can only send them deeper.

And we don't know that the level with old Saito is limbo. We only know it's a dream at least one level deeper than the one where Cobb interacts with Mal and Ariadne. So when old Saito spins Cobb's totem and shoots Cobb, that can only send Cobb to limbo - where he's reunited with his  children and where James says, in a house on a cliff, ""we're building a house on a cliff"".

Why? This is the only way Saito's phone call can wipe away Cobb's murder conviction. Even for someone as wealthy as Saito, doing so is impossible in the real world. So Saito's solution is to learn Cobb's Inception technique and use it on Cobb himself. While Saito doesn’t know the physical properties of Cobb's top — how long it spins – he implants in Cobb the idea that it's more important to be a young man and see his children than to check the totem.

Of course some may still say the ending is ambiguous even knowing that the top spins more than twice as long as it should. That just means Nolan has successfully implanted the idea in your head that the ending is ambiguous ... ;-)","{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': 0.7972}",0.085,0.049,0.866,0.7972,Positive

Some reasons are definitely more a matter of personal tastes and I can see why people enjoy it, but I wanted to hear what fans of this movie think from a technical standpoint in particular. I rarely ever hear people talk about the cinematography, production design, costumes, or the editing. The two technical elements I hear often are the score and the visual effects ( the latter of which I cannot deny is great).

Nolan regardless has great ideas, and I do not understand anyone who calls him talentless. But certain aspects of filmmaking in his movies can be very hit or miss for me (and in this one, almost every aspect was a miss for me unfortunately).

I find it really difficult to express my thoughts, and I already spent 116 paragraphs in the review I linked, but the aspects of filmmaking I mentioned in the first paragraph are the ones I want to hear more thoughts on from people. Whether you read the review I made or if you decide to post your thoughts here without reading the review and wait for me to reply are your call.

One of the main questions I currently have is what exactly qualifies as a kick. Because of the synchronous kicks thing, there are moments where the kicks don't happen in lower levels, so I ended up confused on that part and would like to hear answers from people.

Also have a lot of questions about the scene where Mal is on the ledge outside the hotel. I can't tell if Mal walked to the other building and waited for Cobb or if she got to the other ledge from Cobb's window (assuming the former because the jump looked to big, but Cobb was gesturing to come back inside so I can't tell).

I also don't know if they ever address the morality of the character's actions in any way. If they do, please explain how rather than saying they do because this in particular wrecked a good chunk of my experience with the movie.

It’s interesting that the men in the film are so sure of the inception process and as the world’s experts on the subject are consistently trying to persuade and convince females of its worth and legitimacy - Mal and Ariadne both experience this. And as usual, they dismiss any and all concerns of women. 

The play on male tendency to rely on facts, truth, and logic versus a woman’s ability to feel, intuit, and perceive is uncanny. Mal literally hides her truth away in her mind and Leo, a man, breaks in to replace it and manipulate her! I call emotional abuse! In the end scene between them, Leo actually brings up her “complexity, perfection, imperfection,” as “just not good enough,” before attempting to abandon her to kick back up top. But he’ll stay for SAITO!? What about his wife?! 

The movie’s trick is to make Mal (literally “bad” in Spanish) a pawn and a one-dimensional trick pony when I think the plot’s complexity rests all with her. The movie fails to reconcile dream with memory despite the efforts of the key  elevator scene meant to explain how the two are related in the subconscious. 

After watching the film… do you trust Leo and his own SUBJECTIVE memory of his wife? Do you think it’s possible Mal’s version of events might change your mind?

**In the movie Inception** we learn two things:
- a kick is used to *retrieve* somebody from one dream level deeper.
- In Limbo, you have to *retrieve* yourself; a.k.a. you have to create the kick yourself.

- Airplane - rainy city: wait untill the sedative wears off.
- rainy city - hotel: wait untill the van hits the water.
- hotel - snow area: wait untill the elevator crashes.

**Until here it makes sense for me. But then:**
- a few people *die* in the snow area and are sent to Limbo.
- once you, e.g., throw yourself of a building in Limbo, you'll be send back to the snow area; from there you'll ride up the kick caused by the elevator in the hotel-level.
   - Ariadne and Fischer fall from the balcony.

220,"Mal actually was right and did normal things in Inception, and actually performed inception on Cobb before she ""killed herself"" to make sure he came back to reality eventually too.

A lot of people point out how the different characters in Inception are really different parts of Cobb (I won't go more into this). This implies he is solo dreaming all of it during the movie still and his ""teammates"" are really different parts of his subconscious.

Mal and Cobb used to explore the ""dreamspace"" together but only Mal brought a totem of her own to know where reality is. Cobb is clearly the inexperienced one, also suggested by how he was giddy to explore and ""keep going deeper"".

Mal knows that a totem only works when its owner uses it, in the way the owner designed it to be used, and likely only in private. When Cobb tries to use Mal's totem, he only sets it to be what he wants it to be (much as how when ""Arthur"" talking of inception says ""you took the idea, so you know it's not yours"", though in this case about how the totem works). Keep in mind ""Arthur"" is knowledge from Cobb's subconscious.

Thus Cobb knows this deep down in his subconscious as ""Ariadne"" and ""Arthur"" even mention it to each other and hint to Cobb you must have your own totem and use it your own way and in private, but Cobb mostly brushes it off which is probably the reason he forgot what Mal must have told him about totems sometime before the movie takes place.

Therefore Cobb eventually comes to believe that Mal's totem works for him, as he continues to reliably see what he wants to see. Some time before the movie takes place, he must have lost track of where reality was out of inexperience and no totem of his own. But he eventually (wrongly) settles on a certain dream layer as reality and from then on Mal's totem tells him what he believes (which is wrong).

When Cobb though he was planting inception on Mal in Limbo the first time, he really wasn't because Mal knew the real way her totem should be used, and knew Cobb must have broken into the safe to change it. She knew Cobb was getting restless of Limbo and it was time to go back.

When they get back to ""reality"" as Cobb thinks it, Mal knows it isn't because of her totem and has very normal reactions, such as gently bickering like a partner to partner about how the fake kids are projections, how they will be together, to come with her, and tried to make it easier for Cobb to take the ""leap of faith"" with her by making a mess of the kids and attorneys in that dream layer.

Cobb refuses to believe it but Mal, knowing that her real kids are waiting for her up there, and also being experienced in understanding the time dilation nature of dream levels, decides its okay to leave Cobb. But she plants a very effective inception on him, asking him to take ""a leap of faith"" and evoking the image of a train going where he really wants to go. She then commits ""suicide"" which is really her waking up to higher levels.

Cobb stays stuck and in disbelief, but Mal's inception does its work on him over time, and his subconscious fills in the blank of ""leap of faith"" with becoming ""an old man filled with regrets, ready to die alone"" in his own dream escapades with ""Saito"", which we see in the film. He also sees the train coming for him during the film, which most viewers interpret as a danger and some form of PTSD. But he never actually responds to it in the movie, because he knows deep down the train is trying to kill him to take him back to somewhere ""he really wants to be"" (real life with Mal, not dying alone).

He and ""Saito"" eventually wake up rattled, and Cobb clearly seems changed, likely primed to finally return to reality with Mal and take that ""leap of faith"" after deliberating with his subconscious via ""Saito"".

In the notorious final movie scene he spins Mal's totem again (but we know from this interpretation he only sees what he wants to see). The top spins for an otherwordly long time because he spun it finally accepting that his ""reality"" was still a dream. But when he sees his (fake, projected) children, he has to stall for a bit, which is why we see the top rattle slightly. But he doesn't look happy seeing his phantom children, more with a mood that he's saying goodbye.

Therefore the common interpretation that the end is a philosophical cliffhanger is wrong, the top is set to spin forever because he set it that way being ready to move on. But temporarily we see it rattle a bit as he comes to terms with his ""children"" not being the real ones and saying goodbye. The movie cuts off at an expected time, not abruptly and in the ""clickbait/gotcha"" fashion as most believe.","{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': 0.7538}",0.082,0.071,0.846,0.7538,Positive

So it is possible to dream up drugs, and by these ""dream drugs"" alter even somebody elses mind. The sedative in the first dream level must have been created by someone from the crew and it worked on Fischer. So this in itself is very strange, that you can drug someone else in an artificial dream... Any thoughts on this?

Another thing that interests me is: What drugs can be created in a dream? We see that some drugs can be created in a dream. But can you create non-existent drugs like the drug from Limitless (film), which would turn you into ""big brain"" in a moment?? Or a drug that could make somebody tell only truth??? This would lead to some big plotholes lol.

Fischer was drugged with something that immediatelly made him fall asleep. Like, he was asleep the second after a drop of the drug touched the hood that he had on his head. Such a drug does not exist in the real world so the answer is that you can dream up non-existent drugs. And even if this wasn't the proof and such a drug exists in the real world in the film Inception, then like what could stop you in a dream to dream up a drug that does not exist? When in the dream you can dream up these crazy paradoxes and so on...

So like extraction would be unbelievably easy. You just take a person to 1st dream level and give them the drug that makes you tell the truth and he would tell you everything and you are done, easy. And inception should also be easier... You give the person something which makes them more empathetjc (like MDMA) if you are aiming for a catharsis (like they did with the Fischer and his father).

263,"The question: at the end of Inception, is Cobb dreaming or is he in the real world? (Yes, yes, I know this isn't the point of the movie.)

Most evidence points to the latter.

* His/Mal's totem, the top, wobbles

* His (possible) totem, the wedding ring, is off - it's only on during definite dream sequences

* His kids have aged and have different clothes than when he last saw them 

* It's meta, but Michael Caine spilled the beans that Cobb is awake at the end in an interview 

However, these are not flawless arguments. It's not clear what Cobb's totem is or how it works, his kids aging could be due to his dreaming brain assuming they'd look a bit different after X years apart, and Nolan could've misled Michael Caine. However, the *absence* of music in Cobb's reality indicates he's in the real world.

Music from the level above is used in every level of the inception dream, save Limbo, to act as a signal before a kick. Everyone can hear it, not just the dreamer. If Mal were right and Cobb was stuck in a dream while she was in reality after having killed herself, why did she not immediately play music for him? If he was walking around minding his business and he heard all-encompassing music coming from nowhere, that would be an *unambiguous* signal that Mal was right and was alive in the real world while he was dreaming. This never happens, and given that Mal is more than smart enough to simply put headphones on Cobb, indicates that Cobb isn't dreaming and Mal is really gone.

270,"Hello everyone, one of my absolute favorite parts of the movie is everything that happens in Mombasa. I absolutely love Eames's introduction and the chase scene is awesome. I am aware that there are a decent amount of people that think Mombasa is all a dream. While I think this is an interesting theory, and I can see some of the points that people make on this, I firmly believe that Mombasa was reality. Let's begin.

For one, we are taught about Cobol Engineering early on in the film through dialogue. They hire Cobb to extract plans from Saito's mind. We also learn through dialogue that Cobol does not take kindly to failure: 

*"" You know the corporation who hired us won't accept failure. We won't last two days... ""* 

*""We were supposed to deliver Saito's expansion plans to Cobol Engineering two hours ago. By now they know we failed. Time to disappear.""*

Cobb:  *""What will you do to him?""* Saito:  ""*Nothing. But I can't speak for your friends from Cobol Engineering.""* 

*""Are you giving me a choice? Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol""*  
 

These lines of dialogue exist to make sure the audience knows Cobb's immediate and current relationship with Cobol Engineering now that he failed the Saito extraction job. Cobb's escape from Cobol Engineering is a major part of his reality at the start of the film. There is no reason that these lines of dialogue would be included if the audience was not supposed to believe Cobol was a genuine threat that would come into play a little later in the film.

Flash forward to when Cobb tells Arthur that he needs to find Eames. Arthur lets Cobb know that he thinks it is a bad idea because in his words, Mombasa is *""Cobol's backyard"".*

While in Mombasa, Eames informs Cobb that there is indeed a man at the bar with them tailing Cobb. Cobb instantly recognizes the man as being from Cobol Engineering. Cobb then asks Eames if the bounty that Cobol put on Cobb's head is dead or alive. We all know what happens after. EPIC CHASE WITH EVEN MORE EPIC MUSIC. Speaking of music, I have also seen someone online make a comment that the music for the Mombasa chase is the only music in the film used during an action scene that does not incorporate any parts of the Edith Piaf song. As we all know the Edith Piaf song is what is used to inform dreamers that there time is running out. I find that it only makes sense that the only action scene in the film that takes place in actual reality does not use parts of the Edith Piaf song. Makes sense. 

I now would like to go over some common points that people who say that Mombasa was a dream tend to cite.

**""Eames loses his chips at the table yet he produces two stacks to the cashier""**\- This is to show the audience that Eames is indeed a good forger, as Cobb said, as he is able to produce good forgeries of casino chips minus the misspelling on the chips to which Cobb mentions ""*Your spelling hasn't improved.""* 

**""The guy who grabs Cobb right after he lands says** ***""You're not dreaming now, are ya?""-*** To me, this is actually some major concrete evidence that Cobb is not dreaming. For one, the man does not say this as a question, he says this as a taunt, in the same way for instance that you might quip to your friend who has just misspelled something ""You aren't to smart are ya?"" These men that were sent to kill Cobb were definitely aware that Cobb is a dreamer and failed his dream job, hence why the man taunts Cobb by telling him he is not in a dream and is not in control of things, also possibly to reference the fact that Cobb in reality is in a situation that he is more uncomfortable in.

**""The different guys chasing Cobb all pop out of nowhere""-** No. It only makes sense that these men saw Cobb enter the bar and therefore have many men waiting outside to intercept him when he leaves probably covering all exits. 

**""The city is portrayed as maze-like, very similar to a dream level""-** That's probably because the city of Mombasa is maze-like, something even Christopher Nolan commented on. I believe he also commented on Mombasa being a reference to a dream-like maze in this quote:  *""I wanted to show the potential for the real world to have analogies to the dream world.  The mazelike city of Mombasa does that.""* Christopher Nolan is literally confirming that Mombasa is the real world.

***""*****All of the people at the Coffee House stare at Cobb like projections in a dream""-** Uh, Cobb doesn't exactly blend in with all of the people in there to begin with. Couple that with the fact that he bursts in the building frantically and takes a seat, and a man starts yelling at him ensures that many people who are just there to enjoy a cup of coffee would instantly turn around to see what's happening.

**""Cobb gets stuck between two walls. It is almost like the walls are closing in on him, something that could only happen in a dream""**\- I think people are overthinking this. I think it is meant to be a cool, intense, and stressful moment. Also it is completely possible for two building to have a very narrow alleyway in between, especially in a close quarter maze-like city like Mombasa.

**""In one shot of Cobb trying to squeeze between the walls, in the background you can see a beach like the shores of Limbo""-** This is actually sort of just an illusion created by the image contrast of the shot as well as the brightness of the background. Refer to this image for another example of something in the background appearing white and out of focus: [https://artsandculture.google.com/streetview/national-palace-of-sintra/UwG2LqZ2HJMOzw?sv\_h=8.682253574799432&sv\_p=-16.827559310012674&sv\_pid=DXU1d7Ikagf8BWlXXgssCA&sv\_lid=17997784438551584010&sv\_lng=-9.39129687060202&sv\_lat=38.79803846272751&sv\_z=1](https://artsandculture.google.com/streetview/national-palace-of-sintra/UwG2LqZ2HJMOzw?sv_h=8.682253574799432&sv_p=-16.827559310012674&sv_pid=DXU1d7Ikagf8BWlXXgssCA&sv_lid=17997784438551584010&sv_lng=-9.39129687060202&sv_lat=38.79803846272751&sv_z=1) Look through the windows in this shot. Now use the arrow to move closer to the windows. You can now see all off the trees through the windows when moving closer. Shout out to u/PikachuFloorRug who posted these images in a different thread initially.

**""Saito appears out of nowhere to save Cobb, surely this can only happen in a dream""-** This actually is not as random as some people might think. Cobb, who is also surprised immediately asks Saito ""*What are you doing in Mombasa?""* To which Saito replies ""*I had to protect my investment""*. Saito is referring to Cobb in this quote as his investment as he needs Cobb to be alive to perform inception as he knows how good Cobb is at what he does. It totally makes sense that Saito would be keeping a close eye on Cobb and where he is going so as to protect him while he is assembling his team, hence his appearance to save Cobb as he is being chased by his former employers.

**""After waking up from Yusuf's sedative in the dream basement, Cobb spins his top and we the audience do not get to see the result""-**  I believe that this scene exists to show the audience that Cobb is increasingly becoming worse at determining what is actually reality as he becomes more delusional.

Ok, now that I have addressed to my knowledge almost all of the major points that people who think of the Mombasa scene as being a dream tend to reference, and this post is already extremely long. I should wrap things up.

In conclusion, I believe that the Mombasa sequence exists to add two members to the team, Eames and Yusuf, and to also further solidify the danger that Cobol Engineering poses to Cobb further raising the stakes for his mission. 

Thank you to all who read this extremely long post. I realize that this is somewhat of a rant and I hope I didn't come off as too brash in my opinions, though looking back I realize that I may have. For those of you who do think that this whole sequence is a dream, I disagree but more power to you.

281,"So let's consider:
1. When Ariadne shatters the mirror the cue almost immediately goes to Don's first memories of Mal.
2. Ariadne refuses to let Cobb know what the totem is like, Cobb's regret and grief leading his mind to imagine a scenario of an impossible reality in which the original Mal never let him know how the totem worked that Cobb could incept Mal and create the delusion that spiraled into Mal's suicide. 
3. ""I know who you are"", says Mal to Ariadne. Cobb's mind projecting that the Mal that committed suicide must hate her younger self's naivete, meanwhile Ariadne is so foreign to the idea it all comes across as new ideas altogether. 
4. Ariadne always pushes deeper towards Cobb. She's repulsed by Cobb's projection of Mal, but shared interests has her come back. Ariadne comes into Cobb's mind.  Textually this is more character exposition, subtextually it's Cobb's projection of Young Mal's sense of mischief and willingness to know more about Cobb. 
5. Ariadne represents the facets of Mal that drew Cobb to Mal in the first place: elements of intellectual curiosity (her agreeing to work with Cobb after seeing the dream world), personal curiosity (Ariadne wanting to get to know Cobb better), and raw, genuine talent with dream technology (her talent as an architect stunning Young Cobb, which would eventually grow years later into the ""Idealized"" world Mal and Cobb would create for themselves in the dream world). 

All of this of course only works in the ""it was all a dream"" interpretation of the ending. It does, however, raise another possibility, that the events of the entire movie was an inception against Cobb from some third party. The idea could be a few possibilities: get over separating with Mal (the crux being his confrontation with Mal at the bottom level), stop living in dreams and come back to reality (the crux being that moment with his kids as a sign that he needs to wake up and deal with being a single father), or hell, both aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. Fact of the matter is that the film plants US the idea that it's possible that the film itself was all a dream in the last frame and that opens up a lot of possibilities and implications of what was metaphor for Cobb and what wasn't.

286,"I just want to clear up some of the roles and names. Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of this:

**Architects** design the dream world but don't *necessarily* dream it into existence. The original plan was for Ariadne to create three dream levels, and then to teach one level each to three separate dreamers (Yusuf, Arthur, and Eames). The plan obviously changed and she ended up entering the field, but she didn't actually have to in order for the dream to work.

**Subjects** populate the empty dream world with projections. It's unclear how dream-sharing technology can differentiate the subject from those sharing the dream. It can't be based on the subject's foreknowledge of being in a dream (Cobb still populates Ariadne's dream despite being the only one of the two initially aware that he's in a dream). In a normal, non-hijacked dream, a subject would be also be the dreamer, but when they are hooked up to the dream-sharing device, this role is stolen by a pirate dreamer. 

**Dreamers** (I'd prefer another name, feel free to suggest one - maybe host?) act as a kind of host server, creating the physical dream architecture. They don't populate the world though. An architect is a logical person to act as a dreamer (and in the failed Cobol Engineering heist, the architect was the dreamer/host for the first level) but doesn't have to be. 

So in every extraction, there must be at least one dreamer and one subject. Everyone else is optional or at least variable depending on the job.","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.788, 'pos': 0.158, 'compound': 0.974}",0.158,0.054,0.788,0.974,Positive
287,"I recently rewatched Inception and I've come across some plot holes/inconsistencies. None of them are huge and I can probably live with them, but I'd really like to resolve them so that I can go back to enjoying the movie the way I did before. I'm new to this subreddit, so I apologize if some of these questions have been asked before.

1. **In the first dream level, why didn't the team give themselves a taxi to start with?** 

They knew the plan was to pose as taxi drivers to pick up Fischer. They also get to choose the ""starting conditions"" of the dream since it's Ariadne's and Yusuf's co-construction. Why start out in a completely different red sedan and then be required to steal a taxi at gunpoint? 

2. **Whose subconscious is populating the dream?** 

Is it just the subject (plus Cobb due to his instability) or are all co-dreamers contributing? The exposition of the film tells us that only the subject is populating the dream. Yet the heist team planned on Fischer's subconscious projecting a version of Browning from the beginning, despite Arthur being the subject for that particular level. 

3. **How does Arthur know when to start the music or time his improvised kick in level 2?**

The team made a big deal out of the difficulty of synchronizing the kick during the planning process, saying that it could only be timed if music were utilized. But since the team missed the first kick from level 1, Arthur had to time his improvised kick when the van hit the water. How did he know how long it would take for the van to hit the water? He had no music cue. 

4. **Why didn't Saito kill himself when he first entered limbo?**

Saito has had no difficulty remembering the plan during each successive level of the dream. Why does he suddenly forget the plan and require reminding once he goes to limbo? Ariadne remembers the plan when she goes to limbo, and she's as much of an amateur as Saito, meaning it can't be related to training. Based on the fact that Cobb and Mal are able to wake up from limbo by killing themselves, we know that death within limbo is a convenient exit if desired. Does Saito just not know this?","{'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.088, 'compound': 0.4022}",0.088,0.077,0.835,0.4022,Positive

290,"I finally have a question about the film I can't answer. Hopefully someone can explain this to me.

At the end of the film, Saito and Cobb both die in limbo to wake up in the real world. We know that killing yourself in limbo shouldn't usually wake you up, because not only would Mal and Cobb would have done that the first time they were in limbo, but Mal stabs the shit out of Cobb in limbo at the end and he's completely fine. To get out of limbo, you have to have a kick in the layer above limbo and in limbo at the same time. You can also wait for the sedative to wear off, then you can wake up when you die. I'm fine with all that.

My problem is that the way I interpret the ending is that Cobb presumably spends years searching for Saito, then when he drowns in the van at the first level, his limbo sort of resets and he wakes up in limbo which is already full of the stuff Saito has been making, including his guards which take Cobb to Saito. But when Cobb drowns in the van, they have only been in that first dream level for at most a few hours. Much longer and Fischer's subconscious would've killed them, as Cobb says to Eames after Eames says ""I'm sitting this one out"". If they've only been in that dream level for a few hours, how could the sedative have worn off by the time Saito and Cobb both die in limbo? That would only be less than an hour on the plane. If the sedative only took that long to wear off, then the group would only have to fight off Fischer's subconscious for however long Yusef was driving instead of risking continuing the mission and falling into limbo. So why didn't they just do that? 

I think the only thing throwing me off is the timing of Cobb waking up in limbo after drowning in the van. If the sedative hadn't worn off by the time everyone woke up in the van, then they would still have to fight off Fischer's subconscious in the first level for a week and would certainly have fallen into limbo.

I really hope someone can answer this because Inception has been my favourite film for years and I've never been able to find a hole in it I can't explain until now.","{'neg': 0.132, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.051, 'compound': -0.9902}",0.051,0.132,0.817,-0.9902,Negative
291,"Using in-movie evidence, here's my case for why Cobb can be sure he's in the real world at the end of the movie.

(1) He knows he incepted Mal in Limbo to question reality. So while it must be unnerving to have your wife kill herself because she thinks real life is one level up, he can at least assure himself (with the attendant guilt) that she was wrong.

(2) Mal and Dom got lost in Limbo when they were experimenting with dreams within dreams. When we meet Yusef, he is skeptical that one could have a stable three layer dream. Cobb counters that with a powerful enough sedative, it is possible. However, and this is where my theory sinks or swims, there is no movie evidence to suggest that a dreamer could reach a fourth level that *is not* Limbo. In other words, it appears from the evidence we are presented with that the possible stages of dreams are as follows: Level 0: Waking Reality; Level 1: Normal Dream; Level 2: Dream within a Dream; Level 3: Dream within a Dream within a Dream; Level 4: Limbo. 

(3) Time acceleration compounds the more layers are added. Normal time dilation is a factor of 12. On Yusef's sedative it was a factor of 20, meaning subjective time was roughly L1: 1 week; L2: 6 months; L3: 10 years; LIMBO: 200 years? Since we're beyond the span of a normal lifetime, it doesn't really matter

(4) Cobb and Mal spent 50 years in LIMBO. They had been experimenting with dreams within dreams. Assuming Limbo is 4 layers down, then they would have spent 21 hours asleep with normal dilation or about 3 hours asleep with Yusef-style sedation. Given that we see them wake up dressed in normal clothes on the floor (and not say in a special spot being taken care of) and that they have not soiled themselves or anything else, let us posit that the total time asleep was probably more than 3 hours, but less than 12. 

(5) Recall that the PASIV machine automatically wakes a sleeper up after a predetermined amount of time if they do not awake for some other reason.

(6) Given the above, let us therefore assume that for this experiment, Cobb and Mal had programmed the PASIV to give them 12 hours so they would have ample time to explore. In this scenario, even with 20x time dilation, they would experience 11 years on Level 3 and then automatically wake up. Based on the timeline of the movie, it has already been at least 2-3 years since Cobb incepted Mal. After 8 more years, he can be sure he is awake because if he is not, the PASIV will wake him up and he'll be lying next to Mal on the floor.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: Because all dreams are finite, if Mal was right Cobb will eventually wake up in the real world or if she was wrong, enough time will pass that Cobb can be certain he is not in a dream.","{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.879, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.8772}",0.08,0.041,0.879,0.8772,Positive
292,"First of all, that movie was so good. I wish I could watch it again for the first time. I’m a little stuck on the totem thing. 
So, Mal used the top to determine if she was dreaming or not. If the top kept spinning, she was in a dream. If it toppled, reality. She locked it away when they went to limbo because she full heartedly chose to believe that limbo was reality. Is the assumption supposed to be that Cobb convinced her to go look at her totem to try to get themselves out of limbo? Otherwise, why would she go back to it? But also… if she trusts the totem enough to leave limbo with Cobb, why wouldn’t she trust it once she’s back in reality to tell her that she’s not dreaming anymore?

296,"I watched the movie for the first time about a week ago and rewatched it with friends yesterday. I've read some theories and explanations to have a pretty solid understanding of it. 

There are a few plot points that are a little confusing, but it all makes sense using a little explanation.

The only thing I can't explain is why Arthur would not have intel on Fischer. It's not even obscure intel either, it would be pretty obvious to assume that Fischer had extraction training and a militarized subconscious. 

The only reason I can come up with is that Arthur double crosses Cobb. 

He also has a few motivations to do so. 

He clearly is attracted to Ariadne (kiss scene) and is likely jealous of Ariadne's fascination with Cobb instead of him.

He is bullied a bit by Eames (chair scene, how to cause inception).

He has professional disputes with Cobb (shot in the head in the dream, inception is impossible).

You can also say that he has personal struggles with Cobb as Arthur is not told about Mal causing issues with their jobs. 

Arthur approaching Fischer with information on Saito's plan in order to exact revenge is something that they would never expect him of doing. In Eames's words, Arthur is a ""stick in the mud"".

A big flaw with Inception is that it's hard to find motivation with characters like Arthur, but using a few key clues we can guess a little about his character. Arthur feels he is unlucky, hence why he uses a loaded die as his totem. He is extremely logical, but understands that the world around him isn't, hence him being the one to use paradoxical architecture in two scenes. 

His dream in the second level is of a hotel complex. This implies a lot of things, but I would say it represents that he is in a transitory period of his life trying to go from one place to another. Arthur is gaining something new by betraying Cobb (his old life) by working for Fischer (his new life). Hence why his dream is a hotel. The job is the staying period between the two.
